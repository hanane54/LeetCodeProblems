## During my Amazon interview for a Software Development Role 

it was requested to create a validation API for certain products. The validator should be flexible, adjustable and shows messages to the user. 

- new Validation rules can be added.
- a Rule can be applied for multiple products and a product can be subject for multiple rules.
- Clear error messages with context should be output to the user in case of refused products.
